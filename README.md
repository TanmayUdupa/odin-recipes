# odin-recipes

This project is a HTML - only project which is a website that displays 3 recipes in 3 different web pages, the links of which will be in the home page (index.html).

Once I have completed this project, I will have demonstrated my skills in using the various HTML tags and attributes such as adding images, links, headings, and so on.
